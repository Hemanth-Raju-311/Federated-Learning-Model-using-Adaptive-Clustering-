# Federated Learning Model with Adaptive Clustering for Client Selection

## Overview

This project implements a Federated Learning model utilizing an adaptive clustering scheme for client selection. The approach enhances the efficiency of client selection through the use of stabilization techniques, specifically a SA-like stabilization technique that employs a probability-based approach to determine whether to retain or decrease the current number of clusters.

## Stabilization Techniques

### SA-like Stabilization

- **SA-like Technique**: Utilizes a probability-based method to decide if the current number of clusters should be maintained or reduced.
### Objective: 
Improve the efficiency and stability of client selection in federated learning by dynamically adjusting the number of clusters based on probability metrics.
